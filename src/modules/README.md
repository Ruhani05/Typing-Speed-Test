# Modules

This folder contains various modules that encapsulate different functionalities of our application. Each module should have a specific responsibility and can be reused across different parts of the project.

## Contents

- This folder consists of different modules depending on the project's requirements. Each module is contained in its own file for better organization and maintainability.

## File Naming Convention

- Folder and file names should be in camelCase.
- Use descriptive names that clearly indicate the purpose of the module. For example, `userService.js` for a module that handles user-related operations.
- Prefer named exports over default exports to avoid naming conflicts and to enable better auto-completion in your IDE.

## Usage

To use a module, import it directly from its file:

```javascript
// Importing a specific function from a module
import { myFunction } from './modules/myModule.js';

// Importing all exports from a module
import * as myModule from './modules/myModule.js';

// Importing all common modules
import * as commonModules from './modules';
```
